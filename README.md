# My Warcraft III Tools
## How to install

- Download the ***GriffonStudios_Warcraft_III_Tools*** folder and the ***Install_Warcraft_III_Tools.ms*** file

- Copy the folder ***GriffonStudios_Warcraft_III_Tools*** and the ***Install_Warcraft_III_Tools.ms*** files in the startup folder of your 3D Studio Max application.

    Example:

        C:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max 2020\scripts\Startup\


## Optional: How to use the custom Warcraft III Icons for 3D Studio Max

- Get the 24i.bmp and the 16i.bmp images from the [MaxIcons](https://github.com/TaylorMouse/MaxScripts/tree/master/MaxIcons) folder

- Place both the "_24i.bmp" and the "_16i.bmp" in the following directory to be able to use them or so that the macro script recognizes it.

      c:\Users\<your user name>\AppData\Local\Autodesk\3dsMax\<version of max>\ENU\usericons\

- NOTE: You need to restart max to take affect.
